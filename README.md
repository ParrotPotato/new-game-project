## Another game development from scratch project

Here is another attempt at making a game from scratch as a learning exercise for getting better at OpenGL. This time the target involves making a fully working game with physics and audio. 

We are using : 

- **SDL2** : For window context handling
- **glew** : For openGL context handling and loading all openGL function pointers.
- **TBD** : physics engine (3rd party would be prefered)
- **TBD** : mesh loading library (3rd party would be prefered)
- **TBD** : audio library (3rd party would be prefered)

#### Progress 

- [x] Setting up basic platform layer which creates SDL window with opengl 
- [x] setting up keyboard and mouse input handling 
- [x] Setting up basic shader
- [ ] Setting up basic vertex renderer 
- [ ] Setting up basic texture renderer
- [ ] Setting up mesh loading (would be preferable to do with a library due to previous experience)
- [ ] Settign up basic lighting
- [ ] Updating this list when above tasks are complete
